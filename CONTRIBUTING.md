# Guidelines for submitting bugs:
All non security bugs should be filed on the Issues tracker:
https://github.com/01org/tpm2-abrmd/issues

Security sensitive bugs or questions should be emailed to *all* maintainers
listed in the [MAINTAINERS](MAINTAINERS) file directly so consensus on the
issue and the appropriate resolution can be reached. Alternatively you may
contact Intel by following the instructions
[here](https://security-center.intel.com/VulnerabilityHandlingGuidelines.aspx)
and they will assist you.

# Guideline for submitting changes:
All changes to the source code must follow the coding standard used in the
surrounding source and documented [here](doc/coding_standard_c.md).

All changes should be introduced via github pull requests. This allows anyone to
comment and provide feedback in lieu of having a mailing list. For pull requests
opened by non-maintainers, any maintainer may review and merge that pull
request. For maintainers, they either must have their pull request reviewed by
another maintainer if possible, or leave the PR open for at least 24 hours, we
consider this the window for comments.

## Patch requirements
* All tests must pass on Travis CI for the merge to occur.
* All changes should adhere to the coding standard.
* All commits must be accurately described by the associated commit message
and be limited to a single "unit" of change as described in:
http://www.ericbmerritt.com/2011/09/21/commit-hygiene-and-git.html
* All commits should adhere to the git commit message guidelines described
here: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ with the following exceptions.
 * We allow commit subject lines up to 80 characters.
 * Commit subject lines should be prefixed with a string identifying the
effected subsystem / object. If the change is spread over a number of
subsystems them the prefix may be omitted.
* All contributions must adhere to the Developers Certificate of Origin. The
full text of the DCO is here: https://developercertificate.org/. Contributors
must add a 'Signed-off-by' line to their commits. This indicates the
submitters acceptance of the DCO.

## Picking a Branch
All bug fixes and changes that are backward compatible should be committed to
the `1.x` release branch. This branch will be merged back into the `master`
branch periodically. If the change you're working on is not backward
compatible (e.g. removes a command line option) then it should not go into
the release branch but instead should go into master directly.

## Guideline for merging changes
Changes must be merged with the "rebase" option on github to avoid merge commits.
This provides for a clear linear history.
