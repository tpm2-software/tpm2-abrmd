for use for packaging for targets that do not support the default
compilation / linking flags.
### Changed

- Refactor daemon main module to enable better handling of error
conditions and enable more thorough unit testing.

reads enabled.

- Output from configure script now accurately describes the state of the
flags that govern the integration tests.

## 2.1.1 - 2019-03-08
### Fixed
- Unit tests accessing dbus have been fixed to use mock functions. Unit
tests no longer depend on dbus.

### Fixed
- Race condition between client connections and dbus proxy object
creation by registering bus name after instantiation of the proxy object.

### Added
- `-Wstrict-overflow=5` now used in default CFLAGS.
- Handling of `TPM2_RC_CONTEXT_GAP` on behalf of users.

`UINT32_MAX`
### Changed
- travis-ci now uses 'xenial' builder
- Significant refactoring of TCTI handling code.

### Fixed
- Bug caused by unloading of `libtss2-tcti-tabrmd.so` on dlclose. GLib
does not support reloading a second time.
- Bug causing `-fstack-protector-all` to be used on systems with core
libraries (i.e. libc) that do not support it. This caused failures at
link-time.

- Integration tests now run daemon under valgrind memcheck and fail when
errors are found.
- CommandSource now tracks max FD in set of client FDs to prevent unnecessary
iterations over FD_SETSIZE fds.
### Fixed

of D-Bus bus type and name used by tpm2-abrmd instance.
- Command line option --dbus-name to control the name claimed by the daemon
on the D-Bus.
- Command line option --prng-seed-file to allow configuration of seed source.

G_MESSAGES_DEBUG is set to 'all'.
